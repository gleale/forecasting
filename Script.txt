Slide 1 — Title & Objective

Content:

Title: “Sales Forecasting with AI — Business Case”

Subtitle: Galderma — AI in Finance & Analytics Leadership Development Program

Script:
“Good morning, today I will present my approach to forecasting sales using AI techniques. The goal of this case is to generate accurate sales forecasts and to demonstrate the methodology in a clear and business-relevant way.”

Slide 2 — Dataset Overview

Content:

Historical sales data from 2018–2024 (monthly)

Train: all except last 12 months

Test: last 12 months (used for validation)

Script:
“I started by exploring the dataset. It contains monthly sales data from 2018 to 2024. To evaluate performance properly, I split the data into training and testing sets: all except the last 12 months for training, and the last 12 months for testing.”

Slide 3 — Methodology

Content:

Models tested:

ARIMA (classical statistical)

Prophet (trend + seasonality)

Steps:

Clean & preprocess data

Train on historical sales

Forecast 12 months ahead

Compare with actual test data

Script:
“My methodology was to test two complementary forecasting approaches: ARIMA, a statistical model well-suited for time series, and Prophet, an AI-based model that captures seasonality and trends. Both were trained on the historical data, and I forecasted the next 12 months, then compared with actual values.”

Slide 4 — Results

Content:

Line chart: actual sales vs ARIMA vs Prophet forecast

Metrics: RMSE, MAPE

Script:
“Here you can see the results. Both ARIMA and Prophet captured the overall trend, but Prophet performed slightly better in detecting seasonality. The error metrics, such as RMSE and MAPE, confirmed that the AI-based approach was more accurate for this dataset.”

Slide 5 — Business Insights

Content:

Sales expected to increase/decrease trend

Seasonal peaks and troughs

Reliable forecasting helps in planning inventory, budgeting, and resource allocation

Script:
“From a business perspective, the forecast shows clear seasonality and a stable upward trend. This means sales planning can anticipate demand peaks and prepare inventory and resources accordingly. Accurate forecasts reduce stockouts and improve financial planning.”

Slide 6 — Conclusion

Content:

Forecasts are reliable within 12 months

Prophet model recommended for production

AI forecasting adds business value by reducing uncertainty

Script:
“To conclude, AI forecasting provides a robust tool for sales planning. Prophet is recommended due to its strong handling of seasonality. This approach can be scaled to other markets and products, bringing value by reducing uncertainty and supporting data-driven decision-making.”
